# Ami (^~^)   ~A Discord Bot.

Ami is an ongoing bot, its base is dervied(because I was lazy).

It's an experimental bot, more commands yet to come, still deciding if I should add everything that  had from the last bot: Like checking MMORPG Profiles etc.

Well:
Bot Owner: Liam#1074
Rewritten by: Quanta#5556 (N)


## requirements
 Check requirements.txt ,  extras are added because of the future addons.

##Installation

after cloning, open config.json, set your Prefix, Token and api_key. Then

*Thank You.*
